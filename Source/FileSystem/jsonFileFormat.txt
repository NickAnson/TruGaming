The Format of the tiles for json chunk tile is shown with an example:

"grass 0 0 25 2"
First is the type of tile, with names that are predefined
Second is whether to animate the tile or not
Third is the index ( or level) the block is currently on
The fourth and fifth strings are the specific block it is inside the chunk
    An example: Say your are in x = 200 -> 400 and y= 200->400 chunk
                So our item 0 is 200,248 -> 240,248, item 1 is 249->297, 240->248, etc...

We are going to use a 720x720 pixel chunk based system,
    So we wend up with a 15x15 tile grid with our 48x res pictures
