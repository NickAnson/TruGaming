The Format of the tiles for json chunk tile is shown with an example:

"wwgrass n 0"
First is the type of tile, with names that are predefined
Second is whether to animate the tile or not
Third is the index ( or level) the block is currently on
The fourth string is the specific block it is inside the chunk so if you range is
    64x64 blocks it can be tile [0, (64*64)-1]


We are going to use a 720x720 pixel chunk based system,
    So we wend up with a 15x15 tile grid with our 48x res pictures
