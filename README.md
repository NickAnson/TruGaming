# TruGaming - A Top-Down Open-World Game

TruGaming is a 2d game written in c++ as a fun personal project. <br>
The code for the game is written with elegance and improving with every update.

A sample of the current version is show below:

Sadly the icons for this game are not commercially free so I can not include them in the code at this time, however <br> in the near future there we be preconfigured binaries for Windows and Linux so you can enjoy it also!

If you encounter any bugs if you do run this please let me know!
